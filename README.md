rpi281x wrapper for Java using SWIG

### To build on a raspberry pi

Run `scripts/createNativeLib.sh` to generate the SWIG java code and generate the libws2811.so native library.

Run `./gradlew assemble` to compile the java code and create a jar containing the compile class files and the native .so file.

### To build from another machine

The machine must be a linux machine, or have a bash-compatible shell like babun, cygwin, or git-bash on windows.

Run `./build-native-on-remote-pi.sh`.  This will copy the project to the pi, and run the script in the previous section, and copy the .so library back to the dev machine. After that, run `.\gradlew assemble` to compile the java code and create a jar containing the compile class files and the native .so file.  The easiest way to use the jar would be to publish it to a maven repository, or your local .m2 repository using `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` and use maven coordinates in your maven or gradle project.
